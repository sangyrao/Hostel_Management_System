            <p>
                We are located in the historical heart of beautiful Bhubaneswar,
                near to all the touristic monuments, just a step from khandagiri 
                Square.
                It makes this Hostel a great starting point for 
                exploring treasures that Bhubaneswar has to offer. Forget about 
                spending money on buses and taxis. 
                Everything that you may care to see is within a walking distance 
                from our place.
                Students staying here will be pleased to do so and will enjoy there 
                each stay here.
